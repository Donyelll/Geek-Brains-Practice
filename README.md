Lesson 2

Tasks:
1. Create three classes: Human, Cat, Robot, which are not inherited from the same class. These classes must be able to run and jump, with the output of information about the action to the console.
2. Create two classes: a treadmill and a wall, when passing through, participants must perform the appropriate actions (run or jump), the result of the execution is printed to the console (successfully ran, could not run, etc.). Obstacles have a length
(for a treadmill) or height (for a wall), while participants are limited to running and jumping.
3. Create two arrays: with participants and obstacles, and let all participants go through this set of obstacles. If the participant could not pass one of the obstacles, then he does not go further along the list of obstacles.
